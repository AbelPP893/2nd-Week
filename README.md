1st Week: Chat GPT: Five priorities for research.  

For decades technological advances have been a critical part of the scientific run and constant evolution of the human society that we know. From the invention of the first analog computer to the use of mobile devices in our daily lives, the adaptation process is always complicated and sometimes rough for some users. Chat GPT is not the exception to the rule, this modeling language came into our society to stay. However, every new technology presents its pros and cons. Van Dis highlights in her paper five points that can be impacted by using Chat GPT in research. The necessity of human verification on the outputs present by researchers is the one that caught my attention because this software can learn so fast and start thinking like a human being and produce research papers as good as humans do. The necessity of having regulatory software or identity will be critical to maintaining opportunities for researchers.

2nd Week: Equitable hiring strategies towards a diversified faculty.

It is well known that companies, universities, and other hiring institutions have been very discriminatory in their selection processes. Age, Sex, Ethnicity, and Sexual Orientation are questioned and used as criteria to determine the capacity of an employee. These previously mentioned "criteria" is unacceptable and will not demonstrate the qualities and capacities that person has. With the creation of new methods that will improve an equally hiring proccess, considering the capacities and education of the future employee with asurance a more diverse and well nourish environment for people. I would like to higlight that as international student, diversity brings more and different perspectives to the table, making any tasks easier to solve. # 2nd-Week

# 3rd Week: Fooling Ourselves 

Due to some lab work, I was not able to attend last Wednesday class, but I read the paper. As a young scientist, I can feel myself identify with what is written in the article. So far, I have experienced two or maybe three situations where my results did not fulfill my expectations, and I tried to blame the experimental design, the samples, or equipment about my poor performance. During the process of finding a explanation about the issue I was not conscious that I was the one originating the problem. It is so easy for us to only focus on the expectations and the desire results that we make more small mistakes or errors than we expected. I would recommend to other young scientists, colleagues, and peers that sometimes a brief break, will help us to recharge our batteries and focus more on those tiny details or mistakes that later could foolish us. 



# 4th Week: Do Financial Conflicts of Interest Bias Research? An Inquiry into the ‘‘Funding Effect’’ Hypothesis

How does this impact our realm of science? That's a question that came to my mind when I was reading this article. It is clear that companies invest millions of dollars on research to prove that their products are good, healthy, or fulfill the expectatives that they advertised. From the scientists' side, it is alwyas great to have the funds and sponsors required to complete a project, but the same funding can be double-edged weapon. The companies expect to obtain the most benefitial result, and that produces a big pressure on the researchers. I consider that scientists could receive the money from the companies, but they will strictly focus on developing the best outcome no matter the expectations of the sponsor. Scientist must completed researchers in the most freely and independent way.
