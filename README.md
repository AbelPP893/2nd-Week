1st Week: Chat GPT: Five priorities for research.  

For decades technological advances have been a critical part of the scientific run and constant evolution of the human society that we know. From the invention of the first analog computer to the use of mobile devices in our daily lives, the adaptation process is always complicated and sometimes rough for some users. Chat GPT is not the exception to the rule, this modeling language came into our society to stay. However, every new technology presents its pros and cons. Van Dis highlights in her paper five points that can be impacted by using Chat GPT in research. The necessity of human verification on the outputs present by researchers is the one that caught my attention because this software can learn so fast and start thinking like a human being and produce research papers as good as humans do. The necessity of having regulatory software or identity will be critical to maintaining opportunities for researchers.

Age, Sex, Ethnicity, and Sexual Orientation are questioned and used as criteria to determine the capacity of an employee. These previously mentioned "criteria" is unacceptable and will not demonstrate the qualities and capacities that person has. With the creation of new methods that will improve an equally hiring proccess, considering the capacities and education of the future employee with asurance a more diverse and well nourish environment for people. I would like to higlight that as international student, diversity brings more and different perspectives to the table, making any tasks easier to solve. # 2nd-Week
