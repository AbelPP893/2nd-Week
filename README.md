2nd Week: Equitable hiring strategies towards a diversified faculty.

It is well known that companies, universities, and other hiring institutions have been very discriminatory in their selection processes. Age, Sex, Ethnicity, and Sexual Orientation are questioned and used as criteria to determine the capacity of an employee. These previously mentioned "criteria" is unacceptable and will not demonstrate the qualities and capacities that person has. With the creation of new methods that will improve an equally hiring proccess, considering the capacities and education of the future employee with asurance a more diverse and well nourish environment for people. I would like to higlight that as international student, diversity brings more and different perspectives to the table, making any tasks easier to solve. # 2nd-Week
